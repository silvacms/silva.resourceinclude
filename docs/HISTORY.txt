Changes
=======

2.2.1 (2010/12/20)
------------------

* Prevent a bug with Grok if ``CHAMELEON_DEBUG`` is set.

* Improve resources merging to prevent where some resources where
  not included in the merged version.

2.2 (2010-10-27)
----------------

* Resource merging is now done when the server is starting. That
  prevent issues in case of multi Zope instance installation.
  Usefull logging is done to know what is merged and how.

* Support for the directive ``only_for`` have been added. It  is the
  equivalent of the ``context`` option used with ZCML directives.
  

2.1 (2010-10-07)
----------------

* Bug fix on windows: fix merged resources to be able to properly
  access other relatives resources.

* Bug fix on windows: fix mode used to open files in order to fully
  get all resource data out of them.

* Vary cache key on ``HTTP_HOST`` for the resource include provider
  (that let you access the same site with different hostname and get
  URL for the hostname you asked in your response).

* plone.memoize is replaced with silva.core.cache.

* It is now to include a ressource only for a given content. The ZCML
