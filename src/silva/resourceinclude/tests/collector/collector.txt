First we need to grok our test and the test resources:

  >>> grok('silva.resourceinclude.tests.collector.collector_fixtures')

Resources are merged when the processus is starting.

  >>> from zope.processlifetime import ProcessStarting
  >>> from zope.event import notify

  >>> notify(ProcessStarting())

We need a test request:

  >>> from zope.publisher.browser import TestRequest
  >>> request = TestRequest()

If we adapts the request with the IResourceCollector we should
get one:

  >>> from zope import component
  >>> from silva.resourceinclude.interfaces import IResourceCollector

  >>> collector = component.getMultiAdapter(
  ...      (object(), request), IResourceCollector)
  >>> collector
  <silva.resourceinclude.collector.ResourceCollector object at ...>
  >>> verifyObject(IResourceCollector, collector)
  True

Our request in our case doesn't have any layer by default, so we
don't have any resources associated:

  >>> collector.collect()
  ()

Now let's get a request which use our test layer:

  >>> from silva.resourceinclude.tests.collector.collector_fixtures.collector import ITestLayer
  >>> request = TestRequest(skin=ITestLayer)
  >>> collector = component.getMultiAdapter(
  ...      (object(), request), IResourceCollector)

There is some resources now:

  >>> merged_resources = collector.collect()
  >>> merged_resources
  (<silva.resourceinclude.resource.MergedDirectoryResourceView object at ...>,
   <silva.resourceinclude.resource.MergedDirectoryResourceView object at ...>)

  >>> merged_resource = merged_resources[0]

We can access to files in static the same way before:

  >>> images_resource = merged_resource.publishTraverse(request, 'images')
  >>> images_resource
  <silva.resourceinclude.resource.ResourceView object at ...>


If files doesn't exists, however we still have an error:

  >>> merged_resource.publishTraverse(request, 'i don\'t know you')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
  NotFound: Object: ... name: "i don't know you"
